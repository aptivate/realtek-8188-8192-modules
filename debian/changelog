  * Actually, mark ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets as conffiles but avoid
    editing them. Sorry for the blunder, reverting the last patch.
  * The last upload was also messed up in terms of source package
    (the orig.tar.gz was missing, so it was erroneously created as
    native source).

openswan (1:2.6.20+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a few problems caused by changes in upstream packaging, e.g. to
    no longer require no_oe.conf hackery as there is now a config file
    option. Removed debconf question for now (commented out, actually).
    Closes: #515098: overwrites local configuration
  * No longer advertise the debian-openswan@gibraltar.at mailing list as
    support address, as I have deleted it. My personal email address
    should be used again.
  * I agree that md[25].[ch] are sufficiently compatible with distribution
    in this Debian package according to http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/RSA-MD-all.
    IANAL, but as far as I judge the situation, there is no license issue.

  * No longer mark ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets as conffiles, as they
    are modified by postinst. Although I don't particularly like this
    method of patching DEBIAN/conffiles, I don't have a better solution
    right now. Thus take patch from Mathieu Parent.

  * Fixed typos in the logcheck ignore files.
    Closes: #298693: openswan: logcheck files - typo
  * Updated debconf translations.
    Closes: #290847: openswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates translation
    Closes: #292077: [INTL:pt_BR] Please apply the attached patch in order to
	    update openswan's pt_BR debconf translation
    Closes: #294202: [l10n] Czech po-debconf template translation (cs.po)
  * Removed the source code for the fswcert utility from the debian/ dir in
    the source package - it is now included in the upstream source under
    programs/.
  * Removed the conflicts with ike-server (still providing it though).
    Closes: #297186: openswan: Remove conflict on ike-server
  * Don't conflict with freeswan generally, but only with versions < 2.04-12.
    (This is in preparation of the freeswan transition package that I am
    working on.)
  * Explicitly remove the execute permissions from /etc/ipsec.d/policies/*.
    Closes: #298245: wrong permissions in /etc
  * No longer need gawk for openswan scripts to work. This allows to finally
    removed the awk-to-gawk hack in debian/rules and means that openswan no
    longer depends on gawk.
  * Enable the building of pluto code for dynamic URL fetching (which needs
    libldap2-dev and libcurl3-dev) and the XAUTH PAM support. Therefore, we
    now build-depend on libpam0g-dev.
    Closes: #292838: openswan: Dynamic CRL fetching not supported

openswan (2.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  Urgency HIGH due to security issue and problems with build-deps in sarge.
  * Fix the security issue. Please see
    http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=190&type=vulnerabilities&flashstatus=false
    or CAN-2005-0162 at
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0162
    for more details. Thanks to Martin Schulze for informing me about this
    issue.
    Closes: #292458: Openswan XAUTH/PAM Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
  * Added a Build-Dependency to lynx.
    Closes: #291143: openswan: FTBFS: Missing build dependency.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Jan 2005 16:10:11 +0100

openswan (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    Important change: aes-sha1 is now the default proposal (but 3des-md5 is
    still supported if the other side requests it). Please look at
    /usr/share/doc/openswan/docs/RELEASE-NOTES for details.
  * Includes KLIPS support for kernel 2.6 for the first time, but I have not
    yet modified openswan-modules-source to cope with that. If somebody wants
    to lend me a hand to address #273443, it would be more than welcome.
  * This release includes a fix for the reported snmpd crash
    (in ipsec_tunnel.c). Many thanks to Nate Carlson for pointing this out.
    Closes: #261892: openswan: System crashes when snmpd runs at the same time
  * Update Build-Depends from libopensc0-dev to libopensc1-dev.
    Closes: #289600: openswan: can't fulfill the build dependencies
  * Update Build-Depends from libcurl2-dev to libcurl3-dev.
  * Include Japanese debconf translation and fix a typo in the master.
    Closes: #288996: openswan: Japanese po-debconf template translation
	    (ja.po) and typo in template.pot
  * Auto-apply the NAT Traversal patch with kernel-patch-openswan again. This
    was changed by openswan (the freeswan version included the NAT-T patch
    automatically). Thus, the patch is now applied before inserting the KLIPS
    part.
  * Include a ready-to-use NAT-T diff in the openswan-modules-source package
    so that anybody who uses this package still has the option of using NAT
    Traversal (though this means patching the kernel anyway, and kind of
    makes the out-of-tree compilation senseless). However, Debian 2.4 series
    kernels should already have NAT-T applied.
  * Document the above two changes in the package descriptions and
    README.Debian.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Jan 2005 09:30:45 +0100

openswan (2.2.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more explanations to README.Debian on how to build the kernel
    modules with either openswan-modules-source or kernel-patch-openswan.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Oct 2004 13:11:48 +0200

openswan (2.2.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  Urgency medium to get this version into sarge - it fixes a bug that turned
  up on some machines and prevented openswan from starting.
  * no_oe.conf will work when there are spaces at the end, many thanks to
    Hans Fugal for figuring that out!
    Closes: #270012: openswan: Fails to start after Installation
	    (/etc/ipsec.d/examples/no_oe.conf problem?)
    I am now sending this towards upstream so that it should hopefully get
    fixed for the next release - it's a bit awkward for a config file.
  * Fixed a minor aesthetical issue in openswan.postinst: when a plain RSA key
    is already present in ipsec.secrets and a new one is being created, a
    needless line was printed. Silenced by adding -q to egrep.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 2004 20:57:22 +0200

openswan (2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also added flex to Build-Depends, the new starter (replacement for
    the init scripts, but not yet active) needs it to build.
    Closes: #272935: openswan_2.2.0-1(ia64/unstable): FTBFS: missing
		     build-depends
    Closes: #273241: openswan: FTBFS: Missing Build-Depends on 'flex'
  * Adapted the rules file of openswan-modules-source to cope with the new
    upstream source code - need to generate a C file from a template before
    the ipsec module can be built.
    Closes: #273144: openswan-modules-source: linux/net/ipsec/version.c
		     neither created nor compiled
  * Enabled the building of modular extensions (AES and cryptoapi) by default
    for openswan-modules-source. Also enabled the AES cipher in addition to
    3DES (this is directly in the ipsec.o kernel module, the modular
    extensions version is an alternative to this).

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Sep 2004 12:38:47 +0200

openswan (2.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added bison to Build-Depends.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Sep 2004 15:18:51 +0200

openswan (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version:
    - Introduces AES support, which is the reason for urgency medium. AES
      should definitly go into sarge.
    - Adds RFC 3706 DPD (dead peer detection) support, see
      /usr/share/doc/openswan/docs/README.DPD for details.
    This adds the last missing piece (AES) to replace the freeswan package
    completely. As of now, freeswan is officially unsupported and will soon
    be removed from Debian. Please upgrade to openswan, which should not cause
    any issues. Configuration files and certificates are completely compatible.
    Closes: #270012: openswan: Fails to start after Installation
		     (/etc/ipsec.d/examples/no_oe.conf problem?)
	    I can no longer reproduce this problem on a fresh install of
	    2.2.0-1.
    Closes: #260120: openswan: Patch fixing #256391 breaks the autogenerated
		     certificate
	    The new X.509 patch included in this upstream release (no longer
	    patched by the Debian package) should fix this too.
    Closes: #246828: /etc/ipsec.conf refers to invalid URLs
	    The default ipsec.conf file distributed by upstream no longer
	    refers to an URL.
  * Fixed a thinko in the postinst script that prevented the correct insertion
    of plain RSA keys into /etc/ipsec.secrets (i.e. not using X.509
    certificates). Fixed now.
    Closes: #268742: openswan: Plain RSA key not successfully written to
		     ipsec.secrets
  * Adapt to the new way of openswan handling the disabling of opportunistic
    encryption. In the default ipsec.conf distributed with upstream openswan,
    OE is now disabled (which changes the previous default). Adapted the
    postinst script so that it can now enable and disable OE support based on
    the debconf option.
    Closes: #268743: openswan: fails to respect debconf OE setting
  * Updated the French and Brazilian Portugese debconf translations.
    Closes: #256457: openswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates translation
    Closes: #264246: openswan: [INTL:pt_BR] Please use the attached Brazilian
		     Portuguese debconf template translation
  * Patched debian/fswcert/fswcert.c to compile cleanly with gcc-3.4. Thanks
    to Andreas Jochens for the patch!
    Closes: #262663: openswan: FTBFS with gcc-3.4: label at end of compound
		     statement
  * Documented how to build the KLIPS kernel part with either the
    kernel-patch-openswan or the openswan-modules-source packages.
    Closes: #246819: Needs documentation on how to build the kernel modules
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1.0, no changes necessary.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Sep 2004 18:13:52 +0200

openswan (2.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, which fixes another potential security issue.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rene@mayrhofer.eu.org>  Sun,  5 Sep 2004 18:00:40 +0200

openswan (2.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  Urgency high because of a possibly security issue.
  * New upstream version. This includes the CRL fix form 2.1.1-5 and the
    proper activation of NAT traversal in Makefile.inc.
    Closes: #253457: Openswan: new upstream available that includes xauth
    Closes: #253458: Openswan: new upstream available that includes xauth
    Closes: #253461: Openswan: new upstream available
    Closes: #253782: openswan: Should automatically load kernel module
		     xfrm_user
    But I have currently not explicitly enabled xaut support in Makefile.inc,
    quoting from there: "off by default, since XAUTH is tricky, and you can
    get into security trouble". If it needs to be enabled to work, please tell
    me and I will need to take a far closer look on it (and the involved
    problems).
    This new upstream version also fixes a possible security issue in the
    X.509 certificate authentication.
  * The last upload didn't seem to have hit the archives, strange...
    However, the bugs are still fixed, closing them now.
    Closes: #245450: openswan should not depend on
	    kernel-image-2.4 || kernel-image-2.6
    Closes: #246847: openswan: shouldn't conflict with ike-server
    Closes: #246373: openswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates translation

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rene@mayrhofer.eu.org>  Thu, 17 June 2004 12:22:45 +0200

openswan (2.1.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from openswan CVS to fix CRL related crashes.
  * Drop the dependency on kernels it works with - the package description
    already says that it will need kernel support to work. This allows people
    to easily use self-compiled kernels with the right support (e.g. 2.6.5).
    Closes: #245450: openswan should not depend on
	    kernel-image-2.4 || kernel-image-2.6
  * While I'm at it, also replace the various Suggests: *freeswan* with
    openswan. Oops.
  * openswan conflicts with ike-server because only one ike-server can be
    active at any given time (it will listen on UDP port 500). This policy
    has been agreed to by all Debian IPSec package maintainers and implemented
    in all ike-server providing packages.
    Closes: #246847: openswan: shouldn't conflict with ike-server
  * Took the debconf translations from the freeswan package and "ported" them
    via debconf-updatepo. Thanks to Christian Perrier for mentioning that it
    was this easy.
    The templates should now be correct (all instances of FreeS/wan replaced
    by Openswan).
    Closes: #246373: openswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates translation

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rene@mayrhofer.eu.org>  Tue, 18 May 2004 19:46:24 +0200

openswan (2.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the kernel-patch-openswan apply script.
  * Warning: Due to an upstream bug, pluto from this version will dump core
    on certain CRLs. If you are hit by this bug, please report it directly to
    upstream, they are still tracking the issue down.


 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rene@mayrhofer.eu.org>  Thu, 15 Apr 2004 09:50:32 +0200

openswan (2.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also build the openswan-modules-source and kernel-patch-openswan
    packages now.
  * Fixed _startklips in combination with the native IPSec stack - many thanks
    to Nate Carlson for the patch.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rene@mayrhofer.eu.org>  Wed, 31 Mar 2004 19:33:49 +0200

openswan (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took the package as official maintainer.
  * Updated all relevant packaging stuff to the level of freeswan 2.04-9,
    including auto-generation of X.509 certificates and insertion in
    ipsec.secrets. This also corrects the libexec path in some scripts.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rene@mayrhofer.eu.org>  Wed, 31 Mar 2004 11:23:46 +0200

openswan (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial version - packaging based on Rene Mayrhofer's
    FreeS/WAN packaging
